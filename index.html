					<h5>Causes of Global Warming</h5>
					<p> Throughout the last few centuries, humans have went through many breakthroughs, from creating steam powered engines leading to the industrialisation of the world and now super advanced technology. It has been reported that 97% of scientists agree, global warming is caused by human activities.

					<h5>Industrialisation</h5>
					<p> Throughout this period, humans as a society has evolved from an agarian society to a industrial society. Intense manufacturing, technology advancements were all introduced during this period due to capitalism which led to more fossil fuels being burnt to provide energy for all the manufacturing, use of technology and labor.

					<h5>Agriculture, Farming</h5>
					<p> Nowadays with advanced technology, farmers are starting to use machines to help them, one example is the tractor and combined harvester which increases a lot of efficiency but at what cost? More fossil fuels are being burned to provide energy for these machines to help farming, increasing the greenhouse effect.

					<h5>Mass Deforestation</h5>
					<p> Mass deforestation contributes the most to the greenhouse effect as trees provide almost 67% of our oxygen and releases the most Carbon dioxide gas in return. When more trees are being cut down, there will be less trees to absorb the carbon dioxide from the atmospheric air and increases the rate of carbon oxidation. Thus there is more greenhouse gases to absorb heat in the air leading to global warming and climate change.
