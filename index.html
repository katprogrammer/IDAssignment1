        <p style="text-align:center">Global Warming poses the biggest threat for the human race in the 21st century.<br>
            With global temperatures rising at an exponential rate, <br> natural disasters occuring more frequently
            around the world <br> and even causing sea levels to rise the highest in the past 100 years.</p>

            <h2>What is Global Warming?</h2>
            <p>The definition of global warming states that it is a gradual increase in the overall temperature of the
                earth's atmosphere generally attributed to the greenhouse effect caused by increased levels of carbon
                dioxide, CFCs, and other pollutants. This is due to the natural greenhouse effect where greenhouse gases
                are released into the atmosphere and traps heat causing the earth temperature to rise.</p>

                    <h5>Causes of Global Warming</h5>
                    <p> Throughout the last few centuries, humans have went through many breakthroughs, from creating
                        steam powered engines leading to the industrialisation of the world and now super advanced
                        technology. It has been reported that 97% of scientists agree, global warming is caused by human
                        activities.

                    <h5>Industrialisation</h5>
                    <p> Throughout this period, humans as a society has evolved from an agarian society to a industrial
                        society. Intense manufacturing, technology advancements were all introduced during this period
                        due to capitalism which led to more fossil fuels being burnt to provide energy for all the
                        manufacturing, use of technology and labor.

                    <h5>Agriculture, Farming</h5>
                    <p> Nowadays with advanced technology, farmers are starting to use machines to help them, one
                        example is the tractor and combined harvester which increases a lot of efficiency but at what
                        cost? More fossil fuels are being burned to provide energy for these machines to help farming,
                        increasing the greenhouse effect.

                    <h5>Mass Deforestation</h5>
                    <p> Mass deforestation contributes the most to the greenhouse effect as trees provide almost 67% of
                        our oxygen and releases the most Carbon dioxide gas in return. When more trees are being cut
                        down, there will be less trees to absorb the carbon dioxide from the atmospheric air and
                        increases the rate of carbon oxidation. Thus there is more greenhouse gases to absorb heat in
                        the air leading to global warming and climate change.

                <h1>Solutions</h1>
                <p>These are the possible solutions to global warming. Firstly using solar panels is a great method of
                    re-newable energy and makes use of the sun's brightness to produce electricity and power
                    devices,machines and buildings!
                    <br><br>
                    Using LED Lights and Electric cars also help increase energy efficiency! Not only do you burn less
                    fossil fuels and emit less carbon, your vehicle and device lasts longeer too!
                    <br><br>
                    Raising Awareness on the issue of global warming is also very important! By spreading more awareness
                    on this issue, more people will call to action and come up with more solutions such as creating
                    campaigns, petitions and donation drives to reduce global warming!
