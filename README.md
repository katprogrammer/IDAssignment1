# Global Warming

The purpose of this website is to raise awareness on the issue of climate change/global warming what is global warming?, why is it important? where is it happening?, educate viewers on what they can do to help climate change.

## Design Process

Provide us insights about your design process, focusing on who this website is for, what it is that they want to achieve and how your project is the best way to help them achieve these things.

This website is for the general public, environmentalists and organizations. This website provides plenty of resources and learning materials for the general public to learn about global warming. It also enables the public to take action immediately by donating and signing petitions.

Organizations will be able to contact SaveGaia easily, provide funding for projects and collaborate to do major events.

Environmentalists can also contribute by submitting possible solutions for global warming (innovating new ideas and devices)

### Organizations

## Features

In this section, you should go over the different parts of your project, and describe each in a sentence or so.

This project consists a total of 6 portions & features.
1. The navigation bar allows user to navigate through the single scroll page website easily. Redirecting users to the 6 different portions.

2. The About portion, gives the definition of global warming as well as a short description and explanation of how it works. This is to give users a brief introduction to global warming.

3. The Causes portion, explains what are the main causes of global warming using an image slider to help visual learners and includes a summary of the portion at the first slide.

4. The Impacts portion, explains the effects of global warming. I included a youtube video for users to learn more about the impacts of global warming and a summary of each impact below the video.

5. The Solutions portion, provides 3 easy solutions for users to try and also shows what the world is doing to tackle global warming. I've included a modern card design where users can hover over a card and see the image of the solution and at the same time read.

6. The Help now portion, shows two ways where users can make a direct change either by donating to charities and organizations that tackle global warming or sign petitions to support anti-global warming campaigns and movements. I've added buttons for users to click and it will redirect the user to the donate page or signing page.

7. Contact Us portion, this is the footer of the page where organizations or the general public can send feedback/solutions to global warming to SaveGaia email. They can also contact SaveGaia using social media or sending an official email.

- CSS to style the HTML file (Color, animation, sizing, padding and font decoration) (https://www.w3.org/)

## Testing

For any scenarios that have not been automated, test the user stories manually and provide as much detail as is relevant. A particularly useful form for describing your testing process is via scenarios, such as:

1. Contact form:
    1. Go to the "Contact Us" page
    2. Try to submit the empty form and verify that an error message about the required fields appears
    3. Try to submit the form with an invalid email address and verify that a relevant error message appears
    4. Try to submit the form with all inputs valid and verify that a success message appears.

In addition, you should mention in this section how your project looks and works on different browsers and screen sizes.

You should also mention in this section any interesting bugs or problems you discovered during your testing, even if you haven't addressed them yet.

If this section grows too long, you may want to split it off into a separate file and link to it from here.
